This project implements a YACC/Bison-based parser that analyzes the syntax of a C-like language and maintains a symbol table to track variables, functions, and their scopes. The parser generates a detailed parse tree output and manages semantic information throughout the compilation process.

Key Features:

Syntax analysis using YACC/Bison grammar rules
Symbol table implementation for scope management
Support for variable declarations, function definitions, and expressions
Comprehensive parse tree logging
Semantic validation during parsing
Language Support:

Variable declarations (int, float, void)
Function definitions with parameters
Control flow statements (if/else, for, while)
Expressions with operators (arithmetic, logical, relational)
Array declarations
Function calls with arguments
